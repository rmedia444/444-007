            <p>

                Climate change poses significant risks to global food security, threatening agricultural productivity, food availability, and access to nutritious and affordable food for millions of people worldwide. Rising temperatures, changing precipitation patterns, and extreme weather events such as droughts, floods, and heatwaves disrupt agricultural systems, reduce crop yields, and increase the frequency and severity of food crises. Addressing the root causes of climate change and building resilience in food systems are essential for ensuring food security in a changing climate.
                <br>
                Moreover, climate change exacerbates existing inequalities and vulnerabilities, disproportionately affecting smallholder farmers, women, Indigenous peoples, and marginalized communities. Sustainable agricultural practices, such as agroecology, organic farming, and conservation agriculture, offer solutions for building resilience to climate change while promoting environmental sustainability and social equity. By investing in climate-resilient agriculture, supporting smallholder farmers, and strengthening food systems, we can mitigate the impacts of climate change on food security and ensure that everyone has access to nutritious and culturally appropriate food.
